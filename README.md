# IDMX 11ty Sass Starter

The set of development scripts in this starter is configured to watch and compile a simple Sass structure using 11ty.

The code is located in the `src` folder and the page is created in the `public` folder.

The `settings.json` in the `.vscode` folder sets the `LiveServer` configuration to serve from the `public` folder and can be used to serve the built page.

The build process includes minifiying and autoprefixing of styles via the `postbuild` script, which runs automatically after a `build`.

## Installation

**`npm install`**

>Run this command once to install the needed node modules.

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> This script runs 11ty with hot reload and served at the url localhost:8080. It will reload whenever there are HTML or Sass changes.

**`npm run build`**

> This script does a production build and includes minified, autoprefixed CSS.

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting services such as Netlify.

HERE in the dark, O heart;
                <br>
                Alone with the enduring Earth, and Night,
                <br>
                And Silence, and the warm strange smell of clover;
                <br>
                Clear-visioned, though it break you; far apart
                <br>
                From the dead best, the dear and old delight;
                <br>
                Throw down your dreams of immortality,
                <br>
                O faithful, O foolish lover!
                <br>
                Here’s peace for you, and surety; here the one
                <br>
                Wisdom—the truth!—“All day the good glad sun
                <br>
                Showers love and labour on you, wine and song;
                <br>
                The greenwood laughs, the wind blows, all day long
                <br>
                Till night.”   And night ends all things.
                <br>
                                                    Then shall be
                <br>
                No lamp relumed in heaven, no voices crying,
                <br>
                Or changing lights, or dreams and forms that hover!
                <br>
                (And, heart, for all your sighing,
                <br>
                That gladness and those tears are over, over.…)
                <br>
                And has the truth brought no new hope at all,
                <br>
                Heart, that you’re weeping yet for Paradise?
                <br>
                Do they still whisper, the old weary cries?
                <br>
                “ ’Mid youth and song, feasting and carnival,
                <br>
                Through laughter, through the roses, as of old
                <br>
                Comes Death, on shadowy and relentless feet,
                <br>
                Death, unappeasable by prayer or gold;
                <br>
                Death is the end, the end!”
                <br>
                Proud, then, clear-eyed and laughing, go to greet
                <br>
                Death as a friend!
                <br>
                Exile of immortality, strongly wise,
                <br>
                Strain through the dark with undesirous eyes
                <br>
                To what may lie beyond it. Sets your star,
                <br>
                O heart, for ever! Yet, behind the night,
                <br>
                Waits for the great unborn, somewhere afar,
                <br>
                Some white tremendous daybreak. And the light,
                <br>
                Returning, shall give back the golden hours,
                <br>
                Ocean a windless level, Earth a lawn
                <br>
                Spacious and full of sunlit dancing-places,
                <br>
                And laughter, and music, and, among the flowers,
                <br>
                The gay child-hearts of men, and the child-faces
                <br>
                O heart, in the great dawn!
